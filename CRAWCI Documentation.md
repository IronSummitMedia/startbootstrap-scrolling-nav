## 1. Introduction

In modern theoretical approaches, culture is considered as a value, which is connected to the quality of human living.  The cultural forms have been and are still used for the accomplishment of wider and bigger aims in education, building a democratic society of strong individuals, achieving progress in all sphears of life. The presence of cultural institutions enriches and raises the quality of life, provides economic and spiritual reproduction.

The culture as a resource for development refers to the way of life, the wealth,  the human relationship  with others, including, for example, labor relations and conditions.</p>

If labor market conditions are related in an important way to crime, or an individual’s intentions to commit criminal acts are altered by the economic situation, then one may see the dependency of wages and crimes. At this point, we are assuming that the level of cultural education is linked both to the labor conditions of an individual as well as crime rates. Hence, we hypothesize that the presence of cultural institutions influences crime rate and amount of salaries.</p>

## 2. Application scenario

CRAWCI aligns data from different sources to gain knowledge about the existence of the cultural institutions throughout Italian regions. The project looks at the relationship between the number of cultural institutions, digitalization, average salary and the number of crime reports by region in Italy.
The project aligns 1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km. 

**The aims of CRAWCI Project:**
1. Creating a new mashup (final dataset) by aligning acquired datasets.
2. Producing the final dataset as a 5-star Open Data, following the principles of suggested a 5-star deployment scheme:

- Make your data available on the Web under an open license.
- Make it available as structured data (machine-readable data) (e.g. Excel)
- Make it available in a non-proprietary open format (CSV)
- Use a single data model to publish data on the Web: RDF 
- Link RDF to provide context

3. Visualizing the result by creating an explorable and clickable map.

### 2.1 How CRAWCI can contribute to E-Governance

Advertisements and promotions among citizens to make awareness of the importance of the presence of cultural institutions such as theaters where there are not available that can be deduced from the crime rate can be interesting for the municipalities.

  - Increase awareness
  - Opportunities for information sharing
  - Inspire public participation and collaboration  in a way that enables people to both understand what their governments do and to influence its decisions
  - Greater transparency and accountability
  - Support innovation  in processes of governance
  - Bring the delivery of public services to a new level

### D6 (Mashup)

CRAWCI Project, The final dataset, created 15 November 2019
CSV: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/crawciopendata.csv
RDF: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/dataset.rdf

License: CC BY-SA 3.0 - Creative Commons https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/it/

Content description: This dataset includes1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km.  The result will be presented as an explorable map that allows users to visualize all the data about regions. 

Methodology: The mashup of datasets D1, D2, D4, D5 was done semi-automatically using Python scripts and the library Pandas, which required a CSV version of the datasets as an input. The developed script firstly dropped the unnecessary columns and then the datasets are aligned through the properties "Theaters", "AvarageIncome", "DifuseofInternet", "CriminalReports" and "CulturalInstitutions".

Here is the Python script developed to drop the columns(an example for one of the datasets):

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import csv
df = pd.read_csv('dataset1.csv')
df.head()
to_drop = ['PRAF',
           'RDPR',
           'Data e ora inserimento']
df.drop(to_drop, inplace=True, axis=1)

df.to_csv(r'cleaned-data1.csv', index=False)



```
Here is the Python script developed to align the datasets:
```
import pandas as pd


def Aligner(cleaned-data1,cleaned-data2,outputdata,area):
    a = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data1,encoding='utf-8')
    b = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data2,encoding='utf-8')
    aligned = a.merge(b, on=area)
    aligned.to_csv(outputdata,index=False)
```

### D7 (Types of crimes)

CRAWCI Project, The final dataset, created 15 November 2019
CSV: https://github.com/simayguzel/OpenDataCRAWCI/blob/master/dataset%20and%20rdf/typesofcrimes.csv
RDF: https://github.com/simayguzel/OpenDataCRAWCI/blob/master/dataset%20and%20rdf/crimedataset.rdf
License: CC BY-SA 3.0 - Creative Commons https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/it/

Content description: This dataset contains the total number of reports of all the types of crimes in Italian regions. 

Methodology: **D7** derives from **D2**, the cleaning of which was done semi-automatically using Python scripts and the library Pandas mentioned above. Hence, we managed to obtain the data of our interest, specifically about regions, not cities, for 2016.  However, since the original **D2** does not have a consistent order, there was a need for its manual curation. 

## 4. Quality analysis of the datasets 

This section considers the requirements, established according to the "Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati). The four characteristics to control the level of information quality are:

- **accuracy** (syntactic and semantic) - the data, and its attributes, correctly represent the real value of the concept or event to which it refers;
- **coherence** - the data, and its attributes are not contradictory to other data regarding the context of the use of the owner administration;
- **completeness** - the data is exhaustive for all its expected values and with respect to the relative entities (sources) that contribute to the definition of the procedure;
- **currentness** (or timeliness of updating) - the data, and its attributes is of the "right time" (it is updated) with respect to the procedure to which it refers.

## 5. Ethical-legal analysis

This analysis is designed to assess compliance with legal and ethical aspects in accordance with European, state and local regulations and compliance with good practices relating to publication in open data.

The analysis pays particular attention to aspects related to privacy, licenses, and interest for the purpose of creating a service that balances the public function, transparency and rights of individual citizens.

The Datasets do not include any personal information of individuals since no attributes about individuals are present. Moreover, we did not detect any data that would fit the concept of personal data according to the Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 (https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2013/wp203_en.pdf) “data relates to an individual if it refers to the identity, characteristics or behavior of an individual or if such information is used to determine or influence the way in which that
a person is treated or evaluated” 
 
Hence, identity cannot be inferred. What is more, datasets are not cross-referenced and not connected between other databases and datasets. We have not determined threats related to how information can be identified and connected to specific individuals.

Our final dataset has CC BY-SA 3.0 - Creative Commons https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/it/. This license lets others reuse, adapt, and build upon their works even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit our source and license their new creations under the identical terms. Which means that all new works will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. 

## 6. Technical analysis 

### **D1, D2, D4**

Datasets **D1, D2, D4** are available in English and Italian languages in multidimensional tables which users can export in **.xls, .csv** formats.  Default format: **Comma (,)** separated with codes and labels in separate columns.  The datasets can be can customised by choosing Text File format: **Comma ( , ); Pipe ( | ); Tabullator.**

A CSV should normally follow RFC 4180(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), however, it is not followed most of the time. While analyzing the CSV files of D1, D2 and D4, we have realized that each row end with ",, which does not suit to the CSV format. 

None of the datasets **D1, D2, D4**  was published in. RDF format which gives us a reason to consider all the original datasets as 3-star Open Data.

Finally, **D1, D2, D4** are consistent, all of the datasets follow a well-defined structure and include explanations for the abbreviations.  However, Datasets **D1, D2, D4** make arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase. Moreover, **D2** list types of crimes in a different order to different regions, which made it difficult to manipulate data while extracting necessary information. 

### **D3** 

The **D3** Dataset сan be displayed in tabular format, accessed directly through the URL or downloaded in the following distribution formats: **rdf,turle,json**.

### **D5** 

The original D5 can be downloaded as **.xlsx, .xml, .json,**  or can be exported as **CSV** which can be customized by choosing necessary columns. The dataset is also available in .RDF format but the file is damaged and cannot be opened in a proper way. 

Dataset D5 makes arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase. Also, D5 has empty rows that lack information about theatres and makes harder data processing and data extraction.

Ultimately, none of the datasets were published in RDF format which gives us a reason to consider all the original datasets as 3-star Open Data. What is more, there is no indication about the encoding of the files (if it's ASCII, ISO-8859-1), despite this is encouraged by the ["Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/stampa-e-comunicazione/notizie/2017/08/03/open-data-online-linee-guida-valorizzazione-del-patrimonio-informativo-pubblico). We consider this problem as an acute one since the wrong encoding can potentially lead to various problems in the automatic data processing, for example,  incorrect data results since some cells may be skipped while processing data.

## 7. Creating the CRAWCI Ontology

An ontology is a detailed model of a slice of reality which is based on the facts that we know about that reality. This model is a description of some of the things and some of the relationships between the things that are known about that reality.

We faced the need to create our own ontology once we realized that there was a lack of vocabularies for the description of statistical and crime data that would suit the needs of our project. Even though we managed to reuse some namespaces as(**ds:total_crime_rate**; **ds:average_salary**; **cis:hostsCulturalEvent**), those vocabularies were not enough to record the nature of our data and sufficiently describe it on the Web. 

The **CRAWCI Ontology** modeling was based on the analyzed and extracted data while creating our mashup datasets. Hence, it has been developed in a manner that is intended to promote a shared understanding of cultural heritage information and statistical data. We also paid special attention to modeling crime-related namespaces to provide information on the crime situation in the Italian regions observing the practice of different crime types. In this way, it helps to mediate between different sources of information on the Semantic Web.

The full Ontology documentation and visualization can be found here: https://github.com/simayguzel/OpenDataCRAWCI/tree/master/myDocumentation

### 7.1 The CRAWCI Ontology Visualisation

To visualize our ontology we used <a href="http://rhizomik.net/">Rizhomik tool.

## 8. Mashup Data Curation.

CRAWCI Mashup datasets **D6** and **D7** were produced as a 5-star Open Data, following the principles of a 5-star deployment scheme for data to be published on the Web. Please find below the detailed explanations.


### 8.1 CSV to RDF Conversion

To convert our data we used csv2rdf which is a Java-based application, which relies on Apache Jena to convert tabular data to RDF. https://github.com/anuzzolese/csv2rdf/blob/master/README.md

The binaries can be obtained by compiling the source code with MAVEN from the command line, i.e.

### Compiling

```bash 
mvn clean install
```
Once the source code has been compiled a JAR named stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar is available in the target folder.

### Usage

The JAR stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar can be used as a command-line tool.
The synopsis is the following

```bash
java -jar stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar [OPTIONS] CSV_FILE
```

The options available are the following:

* -s,--separator &lt;char&gt;   
The character used as separator within the CSV file (e.g. , or ;).

* -m,--mapping &lt;file&gt;   
 A file providing the mapping between CSV columns and the properties of our target CRAWCI ontology.
    
 The file contains a set of key=value lines, where each key represents a column position in the source CSV (the counting of positions starts from index 1) and each value is a pair property-datatype composed of property URI form a target ontology or vocabulary and a datatype URI. The property-datatype pairs are separated by the character '>'. The data type is optional, hence it is possible to provide the property URI only without any data type. We remark that if no data type is provided, then the tool tries to infer the more appropriate data type for the value to transform to RDF. 

 Additionally, the following file, named *mapping* and containing key=property>datatype pairs, define the mapping to be used to generate the properties.
 
 ```java
1=http://xmlns.com/geonames/gn:name
2=http://xmlns.com/cis/cis:hostsCulturalEvent
3=http://xmlns.com/ds/ds:average_salary>
4=http://simayguzel.github.io/crawci/hasInternetConnection
5=http://xmlns.com/ds/ds:total_crime_rate
6=http://simayguzel.github.io/crawci/hasDensityofCulturalInstitutions
 ``` 
 
 Hence, the following line provides an example of how to use the tool from the command line in order to obtain RDF from CSV and saving its content into a file named *musicians.ttl*. We suppose that the input CSV is actually a tab-separated file.
 ```bash
 java -jar stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar -s '\t' -m mapping -o crawci.ttl cleandata.csv
 ```
 
 The execution of the tool with the arguments as provided produced the following RDF serialized by using the TURTLE syntax.

**D7**: https://github.com/simayguzel/OpenDataCRAWCI/blob/master/dataset-rdf/crimedataset.rdf


### 8.2 Updating the dataset over time

We do not plan to update CRAWCI datasets as it considers the specific year, namely 2016. However, it would be interesting to analyze other years to see the results in flow.


## 9. Handling the visualization (technical description)

In order to visualize the data the following libraries were used:

* **Bootstrap**: Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library.
* **Chart.js**: For the visualization of school self-evaluation a specific bar chart was chosen (MIT license).
* **GEOJSON**: Leaflet makes it possible to draw polygons directly from geojson files:
               Regions: To help us draw regions, data from Stefano Cudini's repository were used.

### 9.1 The Icons(green circle / red circle)

The average of each column is calculated:
 - Avarage Salary: 29843
 - Avarage Number of Theaters: 36
 - Average Internet Diffusion: 68,32
 - Average Criminal reports: 127087
 - Average of Cultural Density: 0,021185

- If a region has a **higher value** of salary, number of theaters, internet diffusion and cultural density than the average value, **the green circle** appears; else **the red circle** appears.

- However; if a region has a **higher value** of criminal reports than the average value, **the red circle** appears; else **the green circle** appears.

### 10.6 Types of crimes

Our final dataset features 56 types of crimes, after analyzing all of them we ended up paying more attention to some crime types. For example, **theft of art objects** which obviously leads to the conclusion that **the presence of cultural institutions** that have valuable instances in their collections is **directly connected to the potential threat of crime**. Below are the top 7 regions featuring the highest number of **theft of art objects**:

1. Lombardia
2. Toscana
3. Lazio
4. Campania
5. Emilia-Romagna
6. Sicilia

**intellectual property violations** are spread mostly in the regions, many of which represent the highest cultural value in our dataset, ex. **Lazio, Campania** have the highest density of cultural institutions. Also, **Sicilia, Lazio** and **Lombardia** feature the highest number of theatres, which lead us to the conclusion that regions with a **better presence of cultural organizations** can be connected to number of **Intellectual property violations** that include literary works, inventions, and designs that can be considered as results of a more educated and cultural society. 

1. Campania
2. **Sicilia**
3. **Lazio**
4. Puglia
5. **Lombardia**
6. Calabria

**swindles and cyber frauds** and **cybercrime** are present in the regions, 3 of which demonstrate the higher percentage of diffusion of the Internet (**Lombardia, Lazio, Veneto**).

**swindles and cyber frauds**:

1. **Lombardia**
2. Campania
3. **Lazio**
4. Piemonte
5. Emilia-Romagna
6. **Veneto**

**cybercrime**:

1. **Lombardia**
2. Liguria
3. **Lazio**
4. Toscana
5. Piemonte
6. Emilia-Romagna

### 10.7 Correlation

In order to answer our initial question **weather, there is a strong relationship between the density of cultural institutions and(respectively) average salary, internet diffusion and the number of total criminal reports** 
and hence to approve o disapprove our hypothesis "**The presence of cultural institutions increases the average salary and decreases the crime rate"** , we have calculated the correlation coefficients. The correlation is used in statistics to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables. The formulas return a value between **-1**(negative correlation) and **1**(positive correlation). 

By using an online tool (mathsisfun.com/data/correlation-calculator.html), Pearson's correlation is calculated by taking the results from our dataset. **X axis** - the values of **cultural institution density** and **Y axis** - the values of **average salary, internet diffusion, the number of total criminal reports** one by one. 

- Pearson's correlation between the cultural institution density and average salary(the first values in parenthesis stand for the C.I. density while the second ones are for the annual average salary:


 ```bash
 (0.0246,34.290) (0,33.504) (0.0511,35.866) (0.0238,40.459) (0.33,39.674) (0.0131,39.521) (0.0261,37.483) (0.0265,40.187)(0.0341,38.202) (0.0315,35.860) (0.0413,36.687) (0.0312,36.636) (0.0224,31.712) (0.0132,28.581) (0.0263,27.778) (0.0129,31.726) (0.0083,28.578) (0.0132,26.852) (0.0121,25.936) (0.0125,30.332)
  ```
  
  - Correlation between the density of cultural institutions and average salary: **0.35698**. The positive correlation is obtained which proves our hypothesis: when the presence of C.I. is dense, the average salary increases, too.

- Pearson's correlation between the cultural institution density and internet diffusion(the first values in parenthesis stand for the C.I. density while the second ones are for the internet diffusion:

 ```bash
(0.0246,69.1) (0,69.4) (0.0511,65.2) (0.0238,73,7) (0.33,72.5) (0.0131,72.6) (0.0261,73.1) (0.0265,71.9)(0.0341,71.9) (0.0315,69) (0.0413,70) (0.0312,72.9) (0.0224,70) (0.0132,63.2) (0.0263,64.4) (0.0129,62.4) (0.0083,62.7) (0.0132,59.4) (0.0121,60.6) (0.0125,72.4)
 ```
 
   - Correlation between the density of cultural institutions and internet diffusion: **0.25864**. Like average salary, there is a positive correlation between the C.I. density and internet diffusion and it can be deduced that the denser cultural institution presence is, the wider internet spread is.  
 ![alt text](internet-ci.png)

- Pearson's correlation between the cultural institution density and criminal reports(the first values in parenthesis stand for the C.I. density while the second ones are for the number of criminal reports:

 ```bash
(0.0246,207.885) (0,4.085) (0.0511,79.898) (0.0238,475.194) (0.33,620) (0.0131,169.999) (0.0261,35.552) (0.0265,229.630)(0.0341,176.246) (0.0315,30.108) (0.0413,47.067) (0.0312,276.255) (0.0224,43.136) (0.0132,8.205) (0.0263,222.685) (0.0129,149.334) (0.0083,13.570) (0.0132,61.137) (0.0121,176.318) (0.0125,47.465)
 ```
 
  - Correlation between the density of cultural institutions and the number of total criminal reports: **0.69353**. So, there is a positive correlation between them which means that when there is a high density of cultural institutions, criminality increases which also proves our hypothesis.  
![alt text](crime-ci.png)


Therefore, our hypothesis **The presence of cultural institutions increases the average salary and decreases the crime rate** was not fully proved because according to the nature of our hypothesis we were supposed to have a negative correlation between the density of cultural institutions and crime rate. Instead, the correlation turned out to be not only positive but the strongest one among our data.
